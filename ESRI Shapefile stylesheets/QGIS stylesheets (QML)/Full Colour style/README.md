# Strategi Full Colour style

These are QML files for Strategi in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/Strategi-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the font file 'StrategiSymbols.ttf' into your systems font directory (on Windows machines this is (C:\Windows\Fonts)

*Your machine may require a restart for QGIS to recognise this new font*

**3.**  Copy all the QML stylesheets (those files ending .qml) into the same directory as your Strategi ESRI Shapefile data

**4.**  Load your Strategi data into QGIS and it should appear pre-styled

*Aternatively you can load each style individually through the 'Layer Properties' window within QGIS*

**5.**  Although every feature is styled, for use as a contextual map we recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:75,000** and **1:175,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
